All libraries necessary are included, but to install the Teensy libraries, instead please refer to Teensy installation tutorial here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html 

This will install a large number of libraries including those necessary such as SPI.h / Wire.h and Bounce.h

The libraries included can be installed easily using the Arduino IDE Library Manager, which is recommended over using the included libraries. They are included just in case.
